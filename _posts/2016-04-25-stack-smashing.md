description: Slides from a lecture on low-level software exploits and defenses
---

Not much to say about recent work, but I'd like to share a lecture I wrote for
the honors section of the
[systems programming course](https://cs.illinois.edu/courses/profile/CS241)
I am helping teach. It's a broad overview on
[stack buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow)
exploits and common defenses, for the newbie systems programmer, with a few
pretty diagrams that I spent way too much time on...

(Apologies about the PDF viewer if it's not looking quite right. [You can view the slides directly](/static/content/stack-smashing.pdf).)
